# 🏡 Real Estate Project

This repository is the starting point of a **real estate platform**.  
At the moment, it only contains a single text file, but it will evolve into a full application.

## 📖 Vision
The aim of this project is to create a modern real estate web application where users can:

- 📋 Add and manage property listings  
- 🔎 Search and filter properties by location, price, and type  
- 👤 Register and log in to manage personal listings  
- 🏠 Upload property images and details  
- 📱 Access a responsive, mobile-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack
The technologies that may be used in upcoming versions include:

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express or Next.js API routes  
- **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL / MySQL with Prisma or Drizzle  
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js or JWT  
- **Deployment:** Vercel, Netlify, or Docker
